# Ready-React-Portfolio

# About the project

This is the  Ready-React-portfolio, using the CREATE REACT app. This contains contact info, the current projects I did and what am currently doing now. 
When I run the deployment of the website, it refreshes the portfolio with a new look. The faster way the speed, the more buildable to hold. 

# Motivation(s)

as a web developer.
