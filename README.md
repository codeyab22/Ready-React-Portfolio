# Ready-React-Portfolio


This is the portfolio, using the CREATE REACT app. This contains contact info, the projects I did and what am currently doing now. 
The deployment of the website, it refreshes the portfolio with a new look. This is an blown away portfolio that I did that for awhile and 
now that it is deployed. I want to do more projects.

# About the project

This is the  Ready-React-portfolio, using the CREATE REACT app. This contains contact info, the current projects I did and what am currently doing now. 
When I run the deployment of the website, it refreshes the portfolio with a new look. The faster way the speed, the more buildable to hold. 

# Motivation(s)

My motivation is to start over again and make sure the elements are in touch with the format. Another motivation is to be do work that inspires me
as a web developer. Being a web developer is picking my own style and being understanding of the fundamentals of the website.
